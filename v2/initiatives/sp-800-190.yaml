name: "NIST Application Container Security Initiative"
description: >-
  This initiative enforces container security controls as outlined in 
  NIST SP 800-190. It ensures that containerized applications follow 
  security best practices, including vulnerability scanning, trusted 
  image sources, registry security, and proper configuration to minimize risk.
  The initiative enables policy-driven enforcement of security controls 
  throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), providing real-time 
  feedback to developers and enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.

    description: >-
      Implements security controls to reduce risks associated with 
      container images, such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, 
      and unauthorized images. The policies enforce CVE scanning, 
      mandatory security settings, and allow only trusted sources.
    mitigation: >-
      Ensures that all container images meet organizational security 
      policies before deployment. Helps reduce the attack surface by 
      blocking images with vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or 
      unauthorized sources.
