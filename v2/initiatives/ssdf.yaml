    description: >
      Help prevent unauthorized changes to code, both inadvertent and intentional,
      which could circumvent or negate the intended security characteristics of the software.
      For code that is not intended to be publicly accessible, this helps prevent
      theft of the software and may make it more difficult or time-consuming for attackers
      to find vulnerabilities in the software.
    mitigation: >
      Protect all forms of code from unauthorized access and tampering.
