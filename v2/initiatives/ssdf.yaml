full-description: >
  This initiative enforces key controls from the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) to ensure 
  the integrity and security of your software supply chain. It evaluates critical process (PS) rules 
  to detect vulnerabilities, enforce proper access and commit practices, and secure code repositories.
