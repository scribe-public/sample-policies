full-description: "This initiative defines a set of best practices and technical guidelines designed to safeguard every stage of the software delivery process—from code development and build, to testing and production deployment. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring code integrity, authenticating build artifacts, and continuously monitoring system changes to mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks. The framework is adaptable to various environments and aligned with industry standards, providing organizations with actionable steps to enhance their overall security posture."

    full-description: |-
      It's important to ensure that only authorized persons can make administrative changes to the CI/CD system. If an unauthorized person gains access, they could modify pipeline definitions and subvert other controls.

      Both host and application-layer access to CI/CD tools should be protected with multi-factor authentication.

      > :skull: Instead of manipulating code, attackers may target the CI/CD pipeline itself, leading to undetected breaches and long-term damage.

    mitigation: "Restrict dependencies to trusted registries to prevent the introduction of malicious code through third-party packages."
    full-description: |-
      Modern software dependency managers, including `npm`, `maven`, `Nuget`, `pip`, and others, rely on declaring the dependencies required for the application and then fetching them at build time. By configuring the dependency manager to only allow connections to an authorized list of registries, these attacks can be blunted by keeping malicious packages in the public registries from entering the pipeline.

      The trusted repository can also ensure that security policies are enforced on dependencies. For example, trusted repositories could ensure that only dependencies that are free of critical or high vulnerabilities are used. Implementing a control at the repository that returns an error when a component with known vulnerabilities is requested helps to reduce the chances of an attack against a known vulnerability downstream.

      Teams should be aware of implicit runtime dependencies as well as explicit buildtime dependencies (see Control 14).

      > :skull: 
      > Attackers can quickly spread malicious code through dependencies. Attackers might insert malicious code that is then incorporated into the application’s manifest by stealing credentials en masse for sophisticated, targeted thefts.
      > Hackers can also target mistakes and oversights through _typo-squatting_ and _dependency confusion_. Adversaries go to great ends to publish packages under a trusted name or even with common typos so that they are included in builds.
      > All of the stakes are raised exponentially when public repositories are used.

     All artifacts should be stored in a repository at each stage of the build pipeline so that there is clear traceability between the test results and the actual artifact that was tested. This control also helps to enforce the immutability of the artifacts, such that we can compare artifacts in the development, staging and production repositories and ensure that we maintain a chain of control.

     Repositories for dev, stage and production should be segregated so that role-based access control can ensure least privilege at each stage, and so that more stringent policies (such as artifact signing) can be enforced in higher environments.

     Artifacts should be promoted from repository to repository in accordance with the principle of immutability.
