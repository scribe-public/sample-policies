version: "1.0.0"
name: "NIST Supply Chain Integrity Initiative"
description: >-
  This initiative enforces key supply chain requirements from NIST SP 800-53.
  It mandates that container builds include:
    - A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to ensure component inventory and traceability,
      addressing requirements from SR-4 and CM-8.
    - Provenance data to support architectural traceability, as outlined in SA-8.
  Both the SBOM and the provenance artifacts must be cryptographically signed
  to meet integrity requirements specified in SA-12.

  - name: "SBOM Requirement"
    id: SR4_CM8
    description: >-
      Enforce that every container build includes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM),
      ensuring that all components are inventoried and traceable.
      This requirement addresses both SR-4 and the component inventory aspects of CM-8.
    mitigation: "Ensures complete visibility into container components, reducing the risk of unvetted or vulnerable code entering the supply chain."
    rules:
      - uses: sbom/require-sbom@v2
        name: "Require SBOM"
        description: "Ensure an SBOM is provided for all container builds."
        mitigation: "Reject container builds lacking a valid SBOM."

      - uses: images/verify-labels@v2
        mitigation: "Reject images with missing or inconsistent supply chain metadata."
        name: "Verify Supply Chain Labels"
        description: >-
          Confirm that container images include required `opencontainers` labels:
        with:

            - org.opencontainers.image.revision

        description: >-
          Verifies that the SBOM includes valid authors and supplier data
          following NTIA guidelines. Optionally enforces a required_author and
          required_supplier if provided.
        mitigation: "Reject SBOM if authors or supplier metadata fails NTIA criteria."

  - name: "Provenance Requirement"
    id: SA8
    description: >-
      Enforce that every container build includes provenance data,
      supporting traceability within the security architecture as required by SA-8.
    mitigation: "Provides a clear audit trail of the build process, mitigating risks related to unidentified or untraceable changes."
    rules:
      - uses: slsa/l1-provenance-exists@v2

    id: SA12
    description: >-
      Enforce that the SBOM is cryptographically signed to verify its integrity and authenticity,
      aligning with SA-12 requirements.
    mitigation: "Prevents unauthorized modifications by ensuring that only signed SBOMs are accepted."

      - uses: sbom/require-sbom@v2
