full-description: >-
  This initiative ensures that every critical build artifact includes the
  minimum required provenance metadata as specified in SLSA Level 1. By recording
  detailed information about the build process—such as timestamps, authors, and build details—
  organizations establish a traceable chain-of-custody for their software artifacts.
