full-description: |
  This rule verifies that all discovered Dockerhub tokens are set to Active in Dockerhub.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the Dockerhub tokens in the project.
  2. Checks each token's status against the Active status.
     - If a token's status is not Active, the rule flags it as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning Dockerhub resources.

mitigation: |
  Ensure all Dockerhub tokens are set to Active status to prevent unauthorized access.
