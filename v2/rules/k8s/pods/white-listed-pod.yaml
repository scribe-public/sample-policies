description: Verify only pods explicitly listed in the Allowed List are allowed to run.

full-description: |-
  This rule ensures that only pods specified in the whitelist are allowed to run within the Kubernetes cluster.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the pods in the cluster.
  2. Checks each pod against the whitelist specified in the `with.white_listed_pod` configuration.
     - If a pod is not in the whitelist, the rule flags it as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning Kubernetes resources.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that only approved pods are running within the Kubernetes cluster, reducing the risk of unauthorized or misconfigured pods.
