description: "Limit allowed violations in 3rd party scanner reports"

full-description: |-
  This rule verifies that the number and type of violations reported by third-party scanners are within allowed thresholds.
  It checks the evidence for findings matching the specified severities, titles, CWEs, descriptions, and component names.
  Violations are recorded if any findings exceed the configured limits or match blocklisted criteria.
  
  ### **Evidence Requirements**
  - Evidence must be provided by a supported third-party scanner and formatted as generic findings (see the `--parser` flag in `valint`).

mitigation: >-
  Restricts the number and type of violations from third-party scanner reports, helping to enforce organizational security and compliance policies.
