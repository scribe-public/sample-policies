description: Verify only allowed users committed to the repository.

full-description: |-
  This rule verifies that only allowed users have committed to the repository.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the commits in the repository.
  2. Checks each commit's author against the list of allowed user IDs.
     - If a commit's author is not in the allowed list, the rule flags it as a violation.
  3. Checks each committed file against the list of allowed files.
     - If a committed file is not in the allowed list, the rule flags it as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning Git repository resources.

mitigation: >-
  Prevent unauthorized users from committing to the repository by restricting commit permissions to allowed users only.
