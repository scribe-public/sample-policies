description: Verify all commits are signed.

full-description: |-
  This rule ensures that all commits are signed.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the commits in the repository.
  2. For each Commit Rule inspects the 'PGPSignature' property of the commit, if it is not present, the rule flags it as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - The Source SBOM evidence must be provided in the `cyclonedx-json` format.
  - The Source SBOM should include a `metadata.component.properties` array containing properties that identify base images.
  - The Source SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) must include the `PGPSignature` property for each commit Component.

mitigation: >-
  Enforcing signed commits ensures reduced risk of unauthorized changes to the repository.
