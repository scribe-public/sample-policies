description: Verify commits made directly to the main branch are disallowed.

full-description: |
  This rule ensures that no commits are made directly to the main or master branches.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Check SBOM target branch
  2. If the target branch is the main or master branch, the rule looks for commit objects.
  3. If commit objects are found, the rule flags it as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning Git repository resources.

mitigation: |
  Enforcing no commits to the main branch ensures that changes are made through pull requests, allowing for code review and approval before merging.
