description: Verify the SARIF report complies with defined generic rules for compliance and security. vulnerability profiles.

full-description: |-  
  This rule evaluates the SARIF report provided as evidence to verify that it meets a set of predefined generic rules.
  It does so by using helper functions from the `data.sarif` module to:
  
  1. Check that the vulnerability results in the report (found under `input.evidence.predicate.content.runs[0].results`)
     conform to the expected type and severity level as defined by configuration parameters (such as `rule_level`, `precision`, 
     `rule_ids`, and `ignore`).
  2. Ensure that the total number of reported violations does not exceed the maximum allowed (`with.max_allowed`).
  
  If the number of violations exceeds the threshold, a violation is recorded with details including the rule identifier, 
  severity, and the corresponding location in the artifact.
  
  ### **Evidence Requirements**
  
  - Evidence must be provided in a generic format that adheres to the SARIF 2.1.0 schema.
  - The SARIF report should include a structured list of vulnerability results, along with rule definitions and descriptions.
  - The evaluation uses the configuration parameters provided in the `with` section to guide the verification process.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that the SARIF report adheres to the predefined generic compliance rules by validating 
  the vulnerability types, severity levels, and total number of findings. This verification helps maintain 
  a consistent security posture and prevents the use of images with unacceptable
