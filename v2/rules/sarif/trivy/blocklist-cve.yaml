description: "Verify a CVE Blocklist against a SARIF report"

full-description: |-  
  This rule processes the SARIF report produced by the Trivy Vulnerability Scanner to verify that no vulnerabilities 
  matching a predefined blocklist of CVE identifiers are present beyond the allowed threshold. The evaluation proceeds as follows:
  
  The rule iterates over the vulnerability results in the SARIF report (located under 
  `input.evidence.predicate.content.runs[0].results`), and for each result, retrieves the corresponding rule definition from 
  `input.evidence.predicate.content.runs[0].tool.driver.rules` based on the result's ruleIndex. It then checks if the result's 
  ruleId contains any of the CVE identifiers provided in the `with.rule_ids` configuration parameter. If the total number of such 
  findings exceeds the allowed threshold (specified by `with.violations_threshold`), a violation is recorded with details including 
  the rule ID, severity (extracted from the ruleâ€™s properties), and the location where the vulnerability was detected.
  
  ### **Evidence Requirements**
  
  - Evidence must be provided in a generic format adhering to the SARIF 2.1.0 schema.
  - The SARIF report should be generated by the "Trivy Vulnerability Scanner".
  - Evidence filtering based on the product must be applied as defined in the configuration.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that any vulnerabilities matching a predefined CVE blocklist are flagged,
  preventing images with known high-risk vulnerabilities from progressing through the pipeline.
