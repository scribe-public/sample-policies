  This rule ensures that only users in the Allowed List have user access to the Bitbucket repository.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Checks the settings of the Bitbucket repository.
  2. Verifies that only users in the Allowed List have user access.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning Bitbucket repository resources.

mitigation: >
  Ensure that only users in the Allowed List have user access to the Bitbucket repository to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
