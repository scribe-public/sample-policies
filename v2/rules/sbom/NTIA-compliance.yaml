  This rule validates that the SBOM metadata meets basic NTIA requirements for authors and suppliers.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Checks that authors exist, are non-empty, and each author has both a name and email.
  2. Checks that the supplier exists with a non-empty name, URL, and contact. At least one contact must have a non-empty email.
  3. Optionally enforces a required author (case-insensitive match for name/email).
  4. Optionally enforces a required supplier (case-insensitive match for supplier name).
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include metadata for authors and suppliers.

inputs:
  - name: required_author
    description: "The required author (case-insensitive match for name/email)."
    type: object
    required: false
  - name: required_supplier
    description: "The required supplier (case-insensitive match for supplier name)."
    type: object
    required: false

notes:
  - |
    Ensure that the SBOM includes metadata for authors and suppliers to meet NTIA requirements.

    For example,  
    ```yaml
    valint bom my_company/my_image:latest \
      --author-name "bob" \
      --author-email bob@my_company.com \
      --author-phone "123-456-7890" \
      --supplier-email bob@my_company.com  \
      --supplier-name "alice" \
      --supplier-url "https://my_company.com" \
      --supplier-phone "123-456-7890" 
    ```

  required_author: 
    name: "bom"

  required_supplier: 
    name: "alice"
