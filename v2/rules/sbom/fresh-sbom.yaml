full-description: |  
  This rule inspects the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for the artifact to verify that it is not older than the specified duration.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Checks the creation date of the SBOM.
  2. Compares the creation date against the maximum allowed age specified in the `with.max_days` configuration.
     - If the SBOM is older than the allowed duration, the rule flags it as a violation.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a creation date.

inputs:
  - name: max_days
    description: "The maximum allowed age of the SBOM in days."
    type: integer
    required: false

notes: |
  Ensure that the SBOM includes a creation date to verify its freshness.

  **Input Example:**
  
  ```yaml
  - uses: sbom/fresh-sbom@v2/rules
    with:
      max_days: 30
  ```
