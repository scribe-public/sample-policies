description: Verify the SBOM is not older than the specified duration.

full-description: |  
  This rule inspects the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for the artifact to verify that it is not older than the specified duration.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Checks the creation date of the SBOM.
  2. Compares the creation date against the maximum allowed age specified in the `with.max_days` configuration.
     - If the SBOM is older than the allowed duration, the rule flags it as a violation.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a creation date.

mitigation: >
  Ensures that the SBOM is up-to-date, reducing the risk of outdated information and ensuring accurate tracking of components.
