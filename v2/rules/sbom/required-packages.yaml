  Ensures that all required dependencies are included in the SBOM, reducing the risk of missing critical components and ensuring compliance with dependency requirements.

full-description: |  
  This rule verifies that the artifact includes all required dependencies as specified.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the dependencies listed in the SBOM.
  2. Checks each dependency against the required dependencies specified in the `with.required_pkgs` configuration.
     - If a required dependency is missing, the rule flags it as a violation.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a list of dependencies.

inputs:
  - name: required_pkgs
    description: "A list of required dependencies specified as PURLs."
    type: array
    required: true
  - name: violations_limit
    description: "The maximum number of allowed violations."
    type: integer
    required: false

notes: |
  Ensure that the SBOM includes all required dependencies to meet compliance requirements.

  **Input Example:**
  
  ```yaml
  - uses: sbom/required-packages@v2/rules
    with:
      required_pkgs:
        - "pkg:maven/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3@3.9"
        - "pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.15"
      violations_limit: 0
  ```
