description: Verify the artifact includes all required dependencies.

full-description: |  
  This rule verifies that the artifact includes all required dependencies as specified.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the dependencies listed in the SBOM.
  2. Checks each dependency against the required dependencies specified in the `with.required_pkgs` configuration.
     - If a required dependency is missing, the rule flags it as a violation.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a list of dependencies.

mitigation: >
  Ensures that all required dependencies are included in the SBOM, reducing the risk of missing critical components and ensuring compliance with dependency requirements.
