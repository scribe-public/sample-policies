description: Verify all dependencies in the artifact have a license.

full-description: |-  
  This rule inspects the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for the artifact to verify that all dependencies have a complete set of licenses.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the dependencies listed in the SBOM.
  2. Checks each dependency for the presence of a license.
     - If a dependency does not have a license, the rule flags it as a violation.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a list of dependencies with their licenses.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that all dependencies have a complete set of licenses, reducing the risk of legal issues and ensuring compliance with open-source licenses.
