description: Verify the artifact contains only allowed components.

full-description: |  
  This rule inspects the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for the artifact to verify that it contains only allowed components.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the components listed in the SBOM.
  2. Checks each component's type against the allowed types specified in the `with.types` configuration.
  3. Compares each component's name against the allowlist provided in the `with.allowlist` configuration.
     - If a component's type or name is not allowed, the rule flags it as a violation.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a list of components with their types and names.

mitigation: >
  Ensures that only approved components are included in the SBOM, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities
  or unapproved dependencies into the software supply chain.
