  This rule verifies that the artifact includes all specified licenses.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the dependencies listed in the SBOM.
  2. Checks each dependency for the presence of the specified licenses in the `with.licenses` configuration.
     - If a specified license is missing, the rule flags it as a violation.
  3. Accesses the Hugging Face API to validate the licenses.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a list of dependencies with their licenses.
