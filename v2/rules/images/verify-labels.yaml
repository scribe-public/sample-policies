  Ensures that all required metadata labels are present with the expected values,
  which is crucial for traceability, auditing, and compliance with container security standards.

full-description: |
  This rule checks the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for the container image to verify that each 
  required label (as defined in the `with.labels` parameter) exists with the correct value.
  
  1. The rule iterates over the list of required labels provided in the `with.labels` configuration.
  2. For each required label, it examines the `metadata.component.properties` array in the SBOM.
  3. It looks for a property where the name starts with "label_" and ends with the required label key, and
     where the property value matches the expected value.
  4. If such a property is not found, a violation is recorded with the missing label and expected value details.
  
  ### **Evidence Requirements**
  - Evidence must be provided in the `cyclonedx-json` format.
  - The SBOM should include a `metadata.component.properties` array that contains label information.

  - SBOM
  - Images
