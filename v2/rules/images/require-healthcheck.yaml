description: >-
  Checks that the container image includes at least one healthcheck property.

full-description: |-  
  This rule examines the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for a container image to verify that a healthcheck is defined.
  It does so by scanning the `metadata.component.properties` array for any property whose name, when lowercased, 
  starts with "imagehealthcheck_". If at least one such property is found, the image is considered compliant; 
  otherwise, a violation is recorded indicating a missing healthcheck.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM should include a `metadata.component.properties` array with entries that define healthcheck instructions.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that container images define a HEALTHCHECK instruction so that the runtime environment 
  can monitor and manage container health. This minimizes the risk of undetected failures at runtime.
