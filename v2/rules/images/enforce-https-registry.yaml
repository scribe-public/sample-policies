  Checks if the container's registry scheme is HTTPS

full-description: |-  
  This rule examines the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for a container image to verify that the registry connection
  is secure. It does so by scanning the `metadata.component.properties` array for a property named 
  'registry_scheme'. If the value of this property is exactly 'https', the rule passes; otherwise, it fails,
  indicating that the image may have been pulled from an insecure registry.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM should include a `metadata.component.properties` array with an entry for 'registry_scheme'.
