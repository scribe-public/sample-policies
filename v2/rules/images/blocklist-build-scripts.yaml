description: Verify no build scripts commands appear in block list.

full-description: |
  This rule inspects the SBOM (in CycloneDX JSON format) for each Layer component and specifically looks for a property named "CreatedBy". 
  It then checks whether the value of this property contains any substrings specified in the 'blocklist' parameter. 
  If a match is found, the rule generates a violation indicating that a disallowed build script command was used during the build process.

mitigation: >
  Prevents the execution of unauthorized or insecure build scripts during the image build process,
  reducing the risk of malicious command injection and ensuring a more secure supply chain.
