description: Verify the image is not older than the specified threshold.

full-description: |-  
  This rule extracts the Image creation timestamp from the SBOM evidence. It searches for a property named "created" 
  within the image's metadata (specifically under `metadata.component.properties`). The creation timestamp is parsed using RFC 3339.
  
  The rule compares the current time with the sum of the creation time and the maximum allowed age (by days). If the current time exceeds this sum, 
  the rule flags the image as too old and generates a violation with details on the calculated maximum allowed time.
  
  ### **Evidence Requirements**
  - Evidence must be provided in the `cyclonedx-json` format.
  - The SBOM must contain a component under `metadata.component.properties` with a property named "created" in valid RFC 3339 format.

mitigation: >-
  Prevents the deployment of outdated container images—which may include unpatched vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies—
  by enforcing a maximum age limit based on the image's build time.
