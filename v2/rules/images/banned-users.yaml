description: Verify specific users are not allowed in an SBOM.

mitigation: >
  Prevents the execution of container images with default or disallowed user accounts reducing the risk of privilege escalation and ensuring that only secure, non-privileged user configurations are used.

full-description: |  
  This rule inspects the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for a container image to ensure that the image is not configured 
  to run with a banned default user. It does so by examining the `metadata.component.properties` array for a property 
  with the name "user". The value of this property is then compared against a list of disallowed users specified in 
  the configuration (via `with.users`). If the image is found to be running as a banned user (for example, "root"), 
  a violation is recorded.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a `metadata.component.properties` array with an entry where the property name is "user".
  - The disallowed user list (e.g., ["root"]) must be provided in the `with.users` parameter.
