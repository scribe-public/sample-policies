description: |
  Ensures the main container image referenced in the SBOM is from an approved source.

full-description: |  
  This rule extracts the main image’s name and version from the SBOM evidence and verifies that it originates from an approved source.
  It does so by comparing the image name against a list of approved source patterns provided via the configuration (`with.approved_sources`).
  The matching is performed using a case-insensitive, anchored regex.
  
  - If one or more approved source patterns are provided and the image name matches at least one pattern, the image is considered compliant.
  - If the image name does not match any approved source, or if no approved source patterns are provided, a violation is recorded.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a `metadata.component` section containing the main image’s `name` and `version` fields.
  - The approved source patterns must be specified in `with.approved_sources`.

mitigation: >
  Enforces that the main image comes from a trusted source, reducing the risk of deploying images that are compromised or outdated.
  This check helps maintain container security by ensuring that only images matching approved source patterns are used.
