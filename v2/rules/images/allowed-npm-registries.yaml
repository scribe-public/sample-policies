description: Verify that the artifact contains only components from allowed NPM registries.

full-description: |-  
  This rule inspects the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for the artifact to verify that it contains only components from allowed registries.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over NPM components listed in the SBOM.
  2. For remotely installed components, checks the `registryUrl` property to ensure it matches one of the allowed NPM registries specified in the `with.allowlist` configuration.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
  - The SBOM must include a list of components with their types and names.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that only NPM components from approved registries are included in the SBOM, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities
  or unapproved dependencies into the software supply chain.
