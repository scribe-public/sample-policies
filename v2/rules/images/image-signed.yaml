description: |
  Enforces that container images (target_type=container) are cryptographically signed.

full-description: |  
  This rule evaluates the evidence for a container image to determine if it is properly signed. It checks the 
  environment field in the evidence to verify that the `content_type` is set to "attest-cyclonedx-json". If the 
  image name matches any pattern specified in `with.skip_image_regex`, the signature check is skipped, allowing flexibility 
  for images that do not require a signature. Otherwise, if the evidence does not indicate a valid signature, the rule fails.
  
  **Evidence Requirements:**
  
  - Evidence must be provided in CycloneDX JSON format with a `content_body_type` of "cyclonedx-json".
  - The evidence environment must include a `content_type` field that indicates the report is signed (i.e., "attest-cyclonedx-json").
  - The `with.skip_image_regex` parameter allows specifying patterns (e.g., "alpine") to bypass the signature requirement for certain images. 

mitigation: >
  Ensures that only container images with valid cryptographic signatures are deployed, mitigating the risk of tampering.
  By requiring evidence in the CycloneDX attest-cyclonedx-json format, this rule confirms that images have been signed by trusted entities.
