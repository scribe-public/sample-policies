full-description: |-
  This rule ensures that only GitHub repositories in the Allowed List are public.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Checks the repository settings for visibility.
  2. Verifies that the repository is public only if it is in the Allowed List.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning GitHub repository settings.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that only allowed repositories are public, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
