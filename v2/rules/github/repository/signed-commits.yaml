full-description: |
  This rule ensures that all commits in the GitHub repository are signed.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the commits in the repository.
  2. Checks each commit for a valid signature.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning GitHub repository commits.
