  This rule verifies that only users in the Allowed List have admin privileges in the GitHub organization.
  It checks the organization's details and compares the value of the 
  `organization_details.admins` field against the expected value.
  
  The rule iterates over the organization data in the evidence, and if the `admins` field does not match 
  the desired value, a violation is recorded. This ensures that only users in the Allowed List have admin privileges in the GitHub organization.
  
  ### **Evidence Requirements**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning GitHub organization resources.

mitigation: >
