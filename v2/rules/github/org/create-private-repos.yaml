description: Verify only allowed users can create private repositories in the GitHub organization.

full-description: |-
  This rule ensures that only users specified in the allowed list can create private repositories in the GitHub organization.
  Note: this setting is supported only in GitHub Enterprise.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the users in the GitHub organization.
  2. Checks users' permissions to create private repositories against the allowed list specified in the `with.allowed_users` configuration.
     - If a user not on the allowed list has permission to create private repositories, the rule flags this as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning GitHub organization resources.

mitigation: >-
  Ensures that only approved users can create private repositories in the GitHub organization, reducing the risk of unauthorized repository creation.
