  This rule ensures that only users specified in the allowed list can create private repositories in the GitHub organization.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the users in the GitHub organization.
  2. Checks each user's permissions to create private repositories against the allowed list specified in the `with.allowed_users` configuration.
     - If a user not in the allowed list has permissions to create private repositories, the rule flags it as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning GitHub organization resources.

mitigation: >
  Ensures that only approved users can create private repositories in the GitHub organization, reducing the risk of unauthorized repository creation.
