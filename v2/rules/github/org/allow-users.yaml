  This rule ensures that only users specified in the allowed list have access to the GitHub organization.
  It performs the following steps:
  
  1. Iterates over the users in the GitHub organization.
  2. Checks each user against the allowed list specified in the `with.allowed_users` configuration.
     - If a user is not in the allowed list, the rule flags it as a violation.

  **Evidence Requirements:**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning GitHub organization resources.

mitigation: >
  Ensures that only approved users have access to the GitHub organization, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
