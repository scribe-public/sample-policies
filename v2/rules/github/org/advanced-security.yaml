description: Verify Advanced Security is enabled for new repositories in the GitHub organization.

full-description: |-
  This rule verifies that advanced security is enabled for new repositories in the GitHub organization by examining the provided Discovery evidence.
  It checks the organization's details and compares the value of the 
  `organization_details.advanced_security_enabled_for_new_repositories` field against the expected value.
  
  The rule iterates over the organization data in the evidence, and if the `advanced_security_enabled_for_new_repositories` field does not match 
  the desired value, a violation is recorded. This ensures that all new repositories enforce advanced security, significantly reducing the risk of 
  introducing vulnerabilities or unapproved software.
  
  ### **Evidence Requirements**
  - Evidence must be provided by the Scribe Platform's CLI tool through scanning GitHub organization resources.
