## Description  
This rule checks the `tool` field in the SARIF evidence to verify that it matches the expected scanner 
(e.g., "Semgrep Vulnerability Scanner" or "Trivy Vulnerability Scanner"). Set evidence match criteria: 
the `tool` field must equal the expected scanner name to ensure the report is generated by the correct tool. 
A mismatch indicates that the report may not be reliable.

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Evidence must adhere to the SARIF 2.1.0 schema.
- The report must include a valid `tool` field.
