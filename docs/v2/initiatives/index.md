## Initiatives

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [SLSA L1 Framework](docs/initiative/slsa.l1.md) | Evaluate SLSA Level 1 |
| [NIST Application Container Security Initiative](docs/initiative/sp-800-190.md) | This initiative enforces container security controls as outlined in  NIST SP 800-190. It ensures that containerized applications follow  security best practices, including vulnerability scanning, trusted  image sources, registry security, and proper configuration to minimize risk. The initiative enables policy-driven enforcement of security controls  throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), providing real-time  feedback to developers and enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.  |
| [SLSA L2 Framework](docs/initiative/slsa.l2.md) | Evaluate SLSA Level 2 |
| [NIST Supply Chain Integrity Initiative](docs/initiative/sp-800-53.md) | This initiative enforces key supply chain requirements from NIST SP 800-53. It mandates that container builds include:   - A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to ensure component inventory and traceability,     addressing requirements from SR-4 and CM-8.   - Provenance data to support architectural traceability, as outlined in SA-8. Both the SBOM and the provenance artifacts must be cryptographically signed to meet integrity requirements specified in SA-12.  |
| [Blueprint for Secure Pipelines](docs/initiative/bp1.md) | Blueprint for secure pipelines - Gitlab |
| [SSDF Client Initiative](docs/initiative/ssdf.md) | Evaluate PS rules from the SSDF initiative |
