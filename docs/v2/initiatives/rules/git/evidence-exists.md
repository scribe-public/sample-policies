> Evidence **IS** required for this rule and will fail if missing.  
::: 
:::tip 
Signed Evidence for this rule **IS NOT** required by default but is recommended.  
::: 
:::warning  
Rule requires evaluation with a target. Without one, it will be **disabled** unless the `--all-evidence` flag is provided.
::: 
:::info  
Rule is scoped by product and target.  
:::  

## Mitigation  
By confirming that all required evidence exists, this rule guarantees that a Source Code Bill of Materials (SBOM) is fully represented as evidence.
