## Mitigation  
Ensures that all dependencies have a complete set of licenses, reducing the risk of legal issues and ensuring compliance with open-source licenses.



## Description  
This rule inspects the CycloneDX SBOM evidence for the artifact to verify that all dependencies have a complete set of licenses.
It performs the following steps:

1. Iterates over the dependencies listed in the SBOM.
2. Checks each dependency for the presence of a license.
   - If a dependency does not have a license, the rule flags it as a violation.

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Evidence must be provided in the CycloneDX JSON format.
- The SBOM must include a list of dependencies with their licenses.


## Evidence Requirements  
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| filter-by | ['product', 'target'] |
| signed | False |
| content_body_type | cyclonedx-json |
