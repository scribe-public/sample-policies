# Trivy Vulnerability Findings Check  
**Type:** Rule  
**ID:** `trivy-verify-vulnerability-findings`  
**Uses:** `sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity@v2/rules`  
**Source:** [v2/rules/sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity.yaml](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies/v2/rules/sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity.yaml)  
**Rego Source:** [verify-cve-severity.rego](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies/v2/rules/sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity.rego)  
**Help:** https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/valint/generic#trivy-integration-example  
**Labels:** SARIF, Trivy  

Verifies that vulnerability findings in the SARIF evidence from Trivy do not exceed
the defined severity threshold.



## Mitigation  
Ensures that the SARIF report generated by Trivy meets the predefined security criteria, helping to detect critical vulnerabilities and configuration issues early.

## Description  
This rule processes the SARIF report produced by the Trivy Vulnerability Scanner to verify that it 
complies with a set of predefined rules. The evaluation is based on several configurable parameters:

The rule iterates over the vulnerability results in the SARIF report (provided under 
`input.evidence.predicate.content.runs[0].results`), and for each result, it retrieves the corresponding 
rule definition from `input.evidence.predicate.content.runs[0].tool.driver.rules` based on the result's 
ruleIndex. It then evaluates whether the severity (extracted from the ruleâ€™s properties) exceeds the specified 
threshold. If the number of such violations exceeds the allowed maximum, a violation is recorded.

### **Evidence Requirements**

- Evidence must be provided in a generic format adhering to the SARIF 2.1.0 schema.
- The SARIF report should be generated by the "Trivy Vulnerability Scanner".
