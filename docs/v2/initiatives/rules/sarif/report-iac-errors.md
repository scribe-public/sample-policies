# Verify IaC Misconfiguration Threshold in SARIF  
**Type:** Rule  
**ID:** `sarif-iac-findings`  
**Uses:** `sarif/report-iac-errors@v2/rules`  
**Source:** [v2/rules/sarif/report-iac-errors.yaml](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies/blob/main/v2/rules/sarif/report-iac-errors.yaml)  
**Rego Source:** [report-iac-errors.rego](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies/blob/main/v2/rules/sarif/report-iac-errors.rego)  
**Labels:** SARIF  

Verify the number of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) errors in the SARIF report remains below the specified threshold.

:::note 
This rule requires [SARIF Evidence](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/valint/sarif).  
::: 
:::tip 
Signed Evidence for this rule **IS NOT** required by default but is recommended.  
::: 
:::warning  
Rule requires evaluation with a target. Without one, it will be **disabled** unless the `--all-evidence` flag is provided.
::: 

## Mitigation  
Ensures that IaC misconfiguration errors remain within acceptable limits, reducing the risk of deploying images  with insecure configuration settings.



## Description  
This rule evaluates the SARIF report generated by the Vulnerability Scanner to detect vulnerabilities that match
a specified blocklist of CVE identifiers. It processes the report by iterating over its vulnerability results, retrieving
the corresponding rule definitions, and checking if the rule IDs contain any of the CVEs listed in the configuration.
If the total number of matching vulnerabilities exceeds the allowed threshold, the rule records a violation that includes
details such as the CVE identifier, its severity, and the location (artifact URI) where it was detected.

### **Evidence Requirements**

Evidence must be provided in a SARIF 2.1.0 compliant format, generated by the Vulnerability Scanner.
