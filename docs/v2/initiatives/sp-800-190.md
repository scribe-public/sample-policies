# NIST Application Container Security Initiative  
**Type:** Initiative  
**ID:** `SP-800-190`  
**Version:** `1.0.0`  
**Bundle-Version:** `v2`  
**Source:** [v2/initiatives/sp-800-190.yaml](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies/v2/initiatives/sp-800-190.yaml)  
**Help:** https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-190/final  

This initiative enforces container security controls as outlined in  NIST SP 800-190. It ensures that containerized applications follow  security best practices, including vulnerability scanning, trusted  image sources, registry security, and proper configuration to minimize risk. The initiative enables policy-driven enforcement of security controls  throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), providing real-time  feedback to developers and enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.

## Controls Overview

| Control ID | Control Name | Control Description | Mitigation |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|
|  [4.1](#41-41-image-countermeasures) | 4.1 IMAGE COUNTERMEASURES | Implements security controls to reduce risks associated with  container images, such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,  and unauthorized images. The policies enforce CVE scanning,  mandatory security settings, and allow only trusted sources.
 | Ensures that all container images meet organizational security  policies before deployment. Helps reduce the attack surface by  blocking images with vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or  unauthorized sources.
 |
|  [4.2](#42-42-registry-countermeasures) | 4.2 REGISTRY COUNTERMEASURES | Implements controls to secure container image registries by enforcing  HTTPS connections, verifying image freshness, and preventing stale  images from being used.
 | Reduces risks associated with registry security, stale images,  and unauthorized image pulls. Ensures that images are kept up-to-date  and only retrieved from secure sources.

# Detailed Controls

## [4.1] 4.1 IMAGE COUNTERMEASURES

Implements security controls to reduce risks associated with  container images, such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,  and unauthorized images. The policies enforce CVE scanning,  mandatory security settings, and allow only trusted sources.



### Mitigation  
Ensures that all container images meet organizational security  policies before deployment. Helps reduce the attack surface by  blocking images with vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or  unauthorized sources.


### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| [trivy-verify-vulnerability-findings](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity.md) | [4.1.1 Severity-Based Vulnerabilities (Trivy)](rules/sarif/trivy/verify-cve-severity.md) | Ensures that images do not contain high-severity vulnerabilities. Blocks images if any CVEs exceed the defined severity threshold.
 |
| [trivy-blocklist-cve](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/sarif/trivy/blocklist-cve.md) | [4.1.1 High-Profile Vulnerabilities (Trivy)](rules/sarif/trivy/blocklist-cve.md) | Blocks images that contain specific high-profile CVEs that are  actively exploited or widely known.
 |
| [sbom-disallowed-users](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/banned-users.md) | [4.1.2 Default Non-Root User](rules/images/banned-users.md) | Ensures that containers do not run as the root user.
 |
| [images-banned-ports](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/banned-ports.md) | [4.1.2 Banned Open Port 22](rules/images/banned-ports.md) | Blocks images that expose SSH (port 22), which should not be  used in containerized applications.
 |
| [images-require-healthcheck](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/require-healthcheck.md) | [4.1.3 Set HEALTHCHECK Instruction](rules/images/require-healthcheck.md) | Ensures that container images include a HEALTHCHECK instruction  to monitor their runtime health.
 |
| [image-labels](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/verify-labels.md) | [4.1.3 Verify Required Image Labels](rules/images/verify-labels.md) | Enforces the presence of essential OpenContainers labels, such as  creation time, version, and source repository.
 |
| [images-allowed-base-image](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/allowed-base-image.md) | [4.1.5 Approved Source Base Images](rules/images/allowed-base-image.md) | Ensures that base images originate from approved and trusted sources.
 |
| [images-allowed-image-source](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/allowed-image-source.md) | [4.1.5 Approved Source Images](rules/images/allowed-image-source.md) | Ensures that application images are built from approved sources.
 |
| [images-require-signed-image](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/image-signed.md) | [4.1.5 Signed Images](rules/images/image-signed.md) | Ensures that images are cryptographically signed before execution.
 |

## [4.2] 4.2 REGISTRY COUNTERMEASURES

Implements controls to secure container image registries by enforcing  HTTPS connections, verifying image freshness, and preventing stale  images from being used.



### Mitigation  
Reduces risks associated with registry security, stale images,  and unauthorized image pulls. Ensures that images are kept up-to-date  and only retrieved from secure sources.


### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
