# Initiative: SLSA L2 Framework‚Äù

**ID**: `SLSA.L2`  
**Version**: `1.0.0`  
**Source YAML**: `slsa.l2.yaml`  

**Short Description**: Evaluate SLSA Level 2

**Full Description**:

Evaluate SLSA L2 and ensure that provenance information is both recorded and authenticated. This helps protect against unauthorized modifications and ensures artifact integrity."


**Help**: https://slsa.dev/

## Defaults

```yaml
evidence:
  signed: false
```

## Controls Overview

| Control ID | Control Name | Control Description | Mitigation |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| prov_authn | Provenance authenticated | Ensure that provenance metadata for build artifacts is authenticated, confirming that it originates from a trusted source. | Authentication of provenance data prevents attackers from forging or modifying build metadata, ensuring the integrity of the software supply chain. |

# Detailed Controls

## Provenance authenticated (ID: `prov_authn`)
**Description**: Ensure that provenance metadata for build artifacts is authenticated, confirming that it originates from a trusted source.

**Mitigation**: Authentication of provenance data prevents attackers from forging or modifying build metadata, ensuring the integrity of the software supply chain.

### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| prov_exists | [Provenance exists](../rules/slsa/l1-provenance-exists.md) | Ensure that provenance metadata is present for each build artifact, enabling traceability and verification. |
| prov_authn | [Provenance authenticated](../rules/slsa/l2-provenance-authenticated.md) | Verify that provenance metadata is cryptographically authenticated, ensuring it has not been tampered with. |
