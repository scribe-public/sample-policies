**Help:** https://slsa.dev/  
:::tip  
Evidence for this initiative **IS NOT** required by default but is recommended.  
:::  
## **Description**

Evaluate SLSA L2 and ensure that provenance information is both recorded and authenticated. This helps protect against unauthorized modifications and ensures artifact integrity."

## Controls Overview

| Control ID | Control Name | Control Description | Mitigation |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|
|  [prov_authn](#prov_authn-provenance-authenticated) | Provenance authenticated | Ensure that provenance metadata for build artifacts is authenticated, confirming that it originates from a trusted source. | Authentication of provenance data prevents attackers from forging or modifying build metadata, ensuring the integrity of the software supply chain. |

## Evidence Defaults

# Detailed Controls

## [prov_authn] Provenance authenticated

Ensure that provenance metadata for build artifacts is authenticated, confirming that it originates from a trusted source.


### Mitigation  
Authentication of provenance data prevents attackers from forging or modifying build metadata, ensuring the integrity of the software supply chain.

### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| [prov_exists](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/guides/policy-reference/rules/slsa/l1-provenance-exists.md) | [Provenance exists](rules/slsa/l1-provenance-exists.md) | Ensure that provenance metadata is present for each build artifact, enabling traceability and verification. |
| [prov_authn](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/guides/policy-reference/rules/slsa/l2-provenance-authenticated.md) | [Provenance authenticated](rules/slsa/l2-provenance-authenticated.md) | Verify that provenance metadata is cryptographically authenticated, ensuring it has not been tampered with. |
