# NIST Supply Chain Integrity Initiative  
**Type:** Initiative  
**ID:** `SP-800-53`  
**Version:** `1.0.0`  
**Bundle-Version:** `v2`  
**Source:** [v2/initiatives/sp-800-53.yaml](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies/blob/main/v2/initiatives/sp-800-53.yaml)  
**Help:** https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-4/final  

This initiative enforces key supply chain requirements from NIST SP 800-53. It mandates that container builds include:
  - A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to ensure component inventory and traceability,
    addressing requirements from SR-4 and CM-8.
  - Provenance data to support architectural traceability, as outlined in SA-8.
Both the SBOM and the provenance artifacts must be cryptographically signed to meet integrity requirements specified in SA-12.


## Controls Overview

| Control ID | Control Name | Control Description | Mitigation |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|
|  [SR4_CM8](#sr4_cm8-sbom-requirement-sr-4-cm-8) | SBOM Requirement (SR-4 / CM-8) | Enforce that every container build includes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), ensuring that all components are inventoried and traceable. This requirement addresses both SR-4 and the component inventory aspects of CM-8.
 | Ensures complete visibility into container components, reducing the risk of unvetted or vulnerable code entering the supply chain. |
|  [SA8](#sa8-provenance-requirement-sa-8) | Provenance Requirement (SA-8) | Enforce that every container build includes provenance data, supporting traceability within the security architecture as required by SA-8.
 | Provides a clear audit trail of the build process, mitigating risks related to unidentified or untraceable changes. |
|  [SA12](#sa12-sbom-signature-enforcement-sa-12) | SBOM Signature Enforcement (SA-12) | Enforce that the SBOM is cryptographically signed to verify its integrity and authenticity, aligning with SA-12 requirements.
 | Prevents unauthorized modifications by ensuring that only signed SBOMs are accepted. |

# Detailed Controls

## [SR4_CM8] SBOM Requirement (SR-4 / CM-8)

Enforce that every container build includes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), ensuring that all components are inventoried and traceable. This requirement addresses both SR-4 and the component inventory aspects of CM-8.



### Mitigation  
Ensures complete visibility into container components, reducing the risk of unvetted or vulnerable code entering the supply chain.

### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| [require-sbom](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/sbom/require-sbo) | [Require SBOM](rules/sbom/require-sbom.md) | Ensure an SBOM is provided for all container builds. |
| [image-labels](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/images/verify-labels) | [Verify Supply Chain Labels](rules/images/verify-labels.md) | Confirm that container images include required `opencontainers` labels:
 |
| [NTIA-compliance](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/sbom/NTIA-compliance) | [NTIA SBOM Compliance Check](rules/sbom/NTIA-compliance.md) | Verifies that the SBOM includes valid authors and supplier data following NTIA guidelines. Optionally enforces a required_author and required_supplier if provided.
 |

## [SA8] Provenance Requirement (SA-8)

Enforce that every container build includes provenance data, supporting traceability within the security architecture as required by SA-8.



### Mitigation  
Provides a clear audit trail of the build process, mitigating risks related to unidentified or untraceable changes.

### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| [SLSA.L1](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/slsa/l1-provenance-exists) | [Require Provenance](rules/slsa/l1-provenance-exists.md) | Ensure provenance data is present for container builds. |

## [SA12] SBOM Signature Enforcement (SA-12)

Enforce that the SBOM is cryptographically signed to verify its integrity and authenticity, aligning with SA-12 requirements.



### Mitigation  
Prevents unauthorized modifications by ensuring that only signed SBOMs are accepted.

### Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Rule Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| [require-sbom](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/sbom/require-sbo) | [Signed SBOM Requirement](rules/sbom/require-sbom.md) | Validate that the SBOM is cryptographically signed. |
| [SLSA.L2](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/configuration/initiatives/rules/slsa/l2-provenance-authenticate) | [Signed Provenance Requirement](rules/slsa/l2-provenance-authenticated.md) | Validate that the provenance data is cryptographically signed. |
