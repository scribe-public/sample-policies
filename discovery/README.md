## GitLab Organization Attestation

### User

#### Check Users against an Allowlist

Takes a list of allowed users as an input and checks if the users in the organization are part of the allowlist.

```yaml
with:
    allowed_users:
        - user1
        - user2
```

#### Check Users against a Blocklist

Takes a list of blocked users as an input and checks if the users in the organization are part of the blocklist.

```yaml
with:
    blocked_users:
        - user1
        - user2
```

#### Check Admin Users against an Allowlist

Takes a list of allowed admin users as an input and checks if the admin users in the organization are part of the allowlist.

```yaml
with:
    allowed_admins:
        - user1
        - user2
```

#### Verify Number of Admins

Takes the minimum number of admins required as an input and checks if the organization has not more than the specified number of admins.

```yaml
with:
    max_admins: 2
```

### Token

#### Unused Tokens

Takes as input the number of days since the last usage of the token. For each token the rule checks if the token has been used in the last `n` days.

```yaml
with:
    unused_for_days: 90
```

#### Shortly Expiring Tokens

Takes as input the number of days before the token expires. For each token the rule checks if the token will expire in the next `n` days.

```yaml
with:
    exiring_in_days: 30
```

#### Tokens with too long lifetime

Takes as input the maximum number of days a token can be valid. For each token the rule checks if the token is valid for more than `n` days.

```yaml
with:
    exiring_in_days: 365
```

#### Forbid Specific Scopes

Takes a list of scopes as input and checks if any token has the specified scopes.

```yaml
with:
    project_scopes:
        - read_api
        - write_repository
```

#### Allowed Scopes

Takes a list of scopes as input and checks if any token has the specified scopes.

```yaml
with:
    allowed_token_scopes:
        - write_repository
        - read_api
```

### Projects

All the [Push Rules](#push-rules) and [Branch Protection](#branch-protection) rules can be applied to projects here as well. But in order to do so, we need to adjust JSON paths in rego scripts.

#### Projects Visibility

Takes a list of projects that can be public and checks if any project is public.

```yaml
with:
    allowed_public:
        - project1
        - project2
```

#### Inactive Projects

Based on a project timestamp in the `last_activity` field, the rule checks if any project has been inactive for more than `n` days.

```yaml
with:
    inactive_for_days: 90
```

## GitLab Project Attestation

### Abandoned Projects

Based on a project timestamp in the `last_activity` field, the rule checks if the project has been inactive for more than `n` days.

```yaml
with:
    inactive_for_days: 30
```

### Visibility Check

Check if the project is public or private.

```yaml
with:
    visibility: public
```

### Push Rules

#### No Push Rules set

Basically check if the `push_rules` field equals `null`.

#### Member check

Verify the state of the `member_check` field.

#### Prevent Secrets

Verify if the `prevent_secrets` field is set to `true`.

> For some reason, this is only available for projects under an organization attestation.

```yaml
with:
    name: "All Members"
    approvals_required_min: 2
```

### Branch Protection

#### Push Access Level

Verify the `access_level` field in push rules.

```yaml
with:
    branch: "main"
    access_level: 40
```

ALternatively, this rule can be evaluated agains the `access_level_description` field. 

```yaml
with:
    branch: "main"
    access_level_description: "Maintainers"
```

#### Merge Access Level

Verify the `access_level` field in merge rules.

```

Alternatively, we can check for a specific regex.

```yaml
with:
    committer_email_regex: ".*@example.com"
```

#### Committer Name check

You can specify your own pattern to search in the `.yaml` file
```yaml 
with:
  pattern: "(?i)(token|secret)" # Regex pattern
```

#### SAST Scanning Results Evaluation
To be implemented

#### Medium Severity Limit
Verify that the max number of medium severity vulnerabilities is not passed.

```yaml
with:
  # Enter here the max number of a the severity level
  max_allowed_specific_severity: 100
```

#### Critical Severity Limit

## Gitlab API

### Signed commits

#### GL Signed Commits List

Verify that the selected commits have been signed

```yaml
with:
  commit_id_list: []
  private_token: ""
  project_id: ""
```

<u>All fields must contain values</u>

`commit_id_list` is a list that contains the commit id or commit SHA (same term).

`private_token` is your personal acccess token.

`project_id` is the projects ID, can be found on Gitlab.

#### GL Signed Commits Range

Verify that the selected range of commits have been signed. Be cautious multiple Api fetch requests will be made which may take longer than other policies. If there are a lot of commits, it might be beneficial to include query paramters `since` and `until`.

```yaml
with:
  since: "" # ISO 8601 date-time string (optional)
  until: "" # ISO 8601 date-time string (optional)
  project_id: ""
  private_token: ""
```

<u>All fields besides since and until are mandatory</u>

`since` and `until` are both query parameters.

`project_id` is your project's ID. Can be found on Gitlab.

`private_token` is your personal access token.

## Github API

### Signed Commits

#### GH Signed Commits List

Verify that the selected commits have been signed.

```yaml
with:
  commit_id_list: []
  access_token: ""
  owner: ""
  repo: ""
```

<u> All fields must be given values. </u>

`access_token` is your Github's personal access token.

`owner` is the owner of the repo.

`repo` is the name of the repository that you are trying to access the commits.

#### GH Signed Commits Range

Verify that the selected range of commits have been signed.

```yaml
with:
  # Required
  access_token: ""
  owner: ""
  repo: ""
  # Optional
  since: # ISO 8601 date-time string
  until: # ISO 8601 date-time string
  sha:
```

<u> `access_token`, `owner`, and `repo` must all be given string values. </u>

`since`, `until`, `sha` are optional query parameters.

Both `since` and `until` are ISO 8601 date-time strings.

When `sha` is specified, it allows you to set a range from the specific sha of the commit to the head.

`access_token` is your Github's personal access token.

`owner` is the owner of the repo.

`repo` is the name of the repository that you are trying to access the commits.

## Github Repository Attestation

### Signed Commits

Verify that the commits have been signed in a repository attestation.

### Gitlab Approval Settings Policies
